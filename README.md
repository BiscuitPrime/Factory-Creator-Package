# FACTORY CREATOR PACKAGE

The following package grants the user access to a simple modular Factory creation tool. The factory also uses an object pooling method for better optimisation of your games.

To access the creation tool :

-> Window/Factory Creator

-> Fill out the name of the factory object that will be spawned in your scene

-> Once gameObject is spawned, fill out the factory's pool

-> It is ready to use

To call the factory's object creator, call Factory.CreateObject("name") where name is the name you have attributed to your pool
